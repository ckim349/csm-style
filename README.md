# csm-style README

This is a VSCode extension that checks Python style based on "CSM: A Code Style Model for Computing Educators." It uses Ruff, Pylint and Pycodestyle to check a program's style against the NCEA criteria (which includes the whole of PEP8 for level 2 & 3) and provides rationale for each rule, relating them to CSM.

## Usage

Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded. Lines that violate the NCEA criteria will be highlighted in red, and you can hover over them to display a tooltip with the error message. Feel free to use the test_files in this project.
